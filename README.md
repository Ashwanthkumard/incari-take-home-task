## Instructions to Run the Streamlit App standalone
## Setup the server by running the following commands:

```bash
chmod +x start_llama.sh
```

Run the script before starting your Python code:

```bash
./start_llama.sh
```

Start Your Python Script: Once the Ollama service is confirmed to be running, you can start your Python script as usual.

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

And then open the URL provided in the terminal: http://localhost:8501


### clean up port 8501 after testing
```bash
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i :8501)
```

# Instructions to Run the Streamlit App in Docker

Make sure you have ollama installed and running on host machine

```bash
ollama run llama3.2
```

### clean up port 8501 if already in use
```bash
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i :8501)
```

### Build the Docker Image:
```bash
docker build -t my-streamlit-app .
```

### Run the Docker Container:
```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 --name streamlit-app -e OLLAMA_HOST="http://host.docker.internal:11434" my-streamlit-app
```

### Stop the Docker Container:
```bash
docker stop streamlit-app
```

With this setup, Docker will start Streamlit in the same way you currently run it, ensuring consistency across environments.


## Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the performance of the node sequence generation model, the following metrics are used:

### 1. Exact Match Accuracy
This metric calculates the percentage of sequences that perfectly match the reference sequences.

**Formula:**
```
Exact Seq Match Accuracy = (Number of exact seq matches / Total number of sequences) * 100
```

### 2. Precision and Recall
For cases where generated sequences donâ€™t match the reference exactly, Precision and Recall provide insight into how well individual nodes in the generated sequences overlap with the reference.

**Precision:**
Measures the proportion of nodes in the generated sequence that are correct.
```
Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
```

**Recall:**
Measures the proportion of reference nodes that were correctly generated.
```
Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
```

**F1 Score:**
Combines Precision and Recall to balance the two.
```
F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
```

### 3. N-gram Precision (BLEU Score)
BLEU measures n-gram overlap between generated and reference sequences to evaluate sequence similarity more granularly.

- **1-gram Precision:** Checks individual node overlap.
- **2-gram Precision:** Checks pairs of consecutive nodes, and so on.

The BLEU score combines different n-gram precisions, typically up to 4-grams, with weights applied to each. For node sequences, you might prioritize 1-gram and 2-gram precisions if node order is flexible.

**Formula:**
```
BLEU Score = BP * exp(sum(w_n * log(p_n)))
```
where:
- `BP` is the brevity penalty.
- `w_n` is the weight for n-gram precision.
- `p_n` is the n-gram precision.
